    <title>LOCAL INLINE LEGACY BUILD OF TRADE WEBPAGE</title>
    <!--
        The TWebBrowser component runs on Internet Explorer and is thus considered as legacy.
        Thus custom legacy supported libraries had to be build to support this browser component,
        to replace React used in the production online webpage.
        All libraries used is coded by Daniel Wykerd
